# Insulator-position
The identification and positioning of insulator shed feature is of vital significance for insulator cleaning. However, there exist few texture features the insulator and its surface is reflective, which makes it difficult to identify and locate the convex points on the surface of the insulator shed. In order to identify and locate the insulator shed, we propose a method to extract the convex points of the insulator skirt based on the binary image of the insulator and the position of the central axis. Binocular vision technology is applied to obtain the depth change curve of the insulator on its axis, with the help of the depth threshold method and principal component analysis(PCA) method. At the same time, the pixel coordinates on the central axis are used to traverse the depth on the central axis to extract the shed bumps, thereby achieving the spatial positioning of the insulator shed bumps. The experiments show that the bumps on the insulatorâ€™s central axis can be well marked and used in the insulator cleaning robot system.
